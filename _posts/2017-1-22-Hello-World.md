title: Dispatches from the data jungles of Metis
---

Hi, y'all. This blog should chronicle my 12 weeks at Metis SF. We'll cover some of the projects I'll work on throughout that time, some of the stuff I'll learn about, and other interesting yet pertinent stuff. I'll try to keep my politics out of this (though this current political atmosphere is making it increasingly difficult to stay mum).  
My next post should cover my recent foray into New York's MTA turnstile data (week 1 of Metis).

Oh, who am I? 
My name is Giancarlo Garbagnati. I hail initially from San Jose, about an hour south of where I'm currently lodged in SF. Spent 10(!?) years in San Diego for school and work (missing the weather and the Mexican food), then finally back in the bay a little over a year ago.

The blog title 'wranglase' is a reflection of my past experience (molecular biology) and my current endeavours (data science).
