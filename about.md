From the Bay. Escaped to the beach for a decade, then now I'm back in the Bay.

Currently studying data science at Metis SF.

### More Information

Previously found with pipette in hand. Studied Molecular Biology at UCSD (miss me some exceptional Mexican food, and the great weather).

The blog title 'wranglase' is a reflection of my past experience and my current endeavours.
